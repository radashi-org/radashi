If you open a PR that introduces a new function, add it to the "New Functions" section. If you're extending an existing function, add it to the "New Features" section.

The `####` headline should be short and descriptive of the new functionality. In the body of the section, include a link to the PR. You don't need to include a description of the change itself, as we will extract that from the documentation.
