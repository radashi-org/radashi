description: Remove unwanted values from an object
since: 12.1.0

### Usage

Returns a new object without the properties that are `undefined`. Note that non-enumerable keys are never shaken out.

```ts twoslash
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const options = _.shake({
  mode: 'party',
  volume: undefined,
  dancing: false,
  snacks: null,
})
// => { mode: 'party', dancing: false, snacks: null }
```

#### Custom Condition

If you pass a function as the second argument, only the properties that return `false` will be included in the result.

```ts twoslash
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const options = _.shake(
  {
    mode: 'party',
    volume: undefined,
    dancing: false,
    snacks: null,
  },
  value => !value,
)
// => { mode: 'party' }
```
