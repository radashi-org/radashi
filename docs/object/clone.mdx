### Usage

Creates a shallow copy of the given object or array.

Notably, built-in objects like `Map`, `Set`, `Date`, and others are not supported.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const ra = {
  name: 'Ra',
  power: 100,
}

const gods = [ra]

_.clone(ra) // => copy of ra
_.clone(gods) // => copy of gods
```

### Differences from spread syntax

The `clone` function is similar to spread syntax (e.g. `{...obj}`), but it also preserves the prototype of the original object. If a `constructor` property exists on the original prototype, it will be called with the `new` keyword to create a new instance, and all properties will then be copied over to it.

Unlike spread syntax, `clone` also supports cloning arrays.
