### Usage

You have a utility function that is filtering an object's properties somehow. Using `filterKey` will allow your function to filter those properties based on either an array of keys (an allowlist) or a function that returns a boolean for each property.

The `KeyFilter` type provided by Radashi is fundamental in taking advantage of the `filterKey` function. Be sure to use it to ensure type safety and maintainable code.

```ts twoslash
import * as _ from 'radashi'

function filterObject(obj: object, filter: _.KeyFilter) {
  for (const key in obj) {
    if (_.filterKey(obj, key, filter)) {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```
