title: pick
description: Pick only the desired properties from an object
since: 12.1.0
---

### Usage

Given an object and a list of keys in the object, returns a new object with only the given keys.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = {
  name: 'Bass',
  weight: 8,
  source: 'lake',
  brackish: false,
}

_.pick(fish, ['name', 'source']) // => { name, source }
```

### Predicate function

The `pick` function can also accept a predicate function as the filter argument. This allows for more complex filtering logic beyond simple key inclusion or exclusion.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const source = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }

_.pick(source, (value, key) => {
  return value % 2 === 0 // Include only even values
})
// => { b: 2, d: 4 }
```

#### Unsafe predicate function

:::caution

When used with a predicate function, `pick` is potentially unsafe, because of partial type matching performed by TypeScript. If you pass an object with more properties than its TypeScript type has listed, the `value` and `key` parameter types of your callback will be inaccurate.

:::

```typescript
// Example demonstrating potential inaccuracy in `key` and `value` types within `_.pick` callback
import * as _ from 'radashi'

interface User {
  name: string
  age: number
}

function getUserDetails(user: User) {
  return _.pick(user, (value, key) => {
    // TypeScript believes `key` is 'name' | 'age', but at runtime
    // it could be 'email'
    if (key === 'name' || key === 'age') {
      console.log(key, '=', value)
    } else {
      // TypeScript believes this will never run, but it does.
      console.log('Unexpected key:', key)
    }
  })
}

// At runtime, the function may receive an object with more properties
const runtimeUser = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  // This property is not listed in the User type:
  email: 'john@example.com',
}

getUserDetails(runtimeUser)
// Logs the following:
//     name = John
//     age = 30
//     Unexpected key: email
```
