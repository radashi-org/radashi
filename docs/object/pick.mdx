title: pick
description: Pick only the desired properties from an object
---

## Basic usage

Given an object and a list of keys in the object, returns a new object with only the given keys.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = {
  name: 'Bass',
  weight: 8,
  source: 'lake',
  barckish: false,
}

_.pick(fish, ['name', 'source']) // => { name, source }
```

### Predicate function

The `pick` function can also accept a predicate function as the filter argument. This allows for more complex filtering logic beyond simple key inclusion or exclusion.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const source = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }

_.pick(source, (value, key) => {
  return value % 2 === 0 // Include only even values
})
// => { b: 2, d: 4 }
```
