title: cloneDeep
description: Create a deep copy of an object or array
---

### Usage

Deeply clone the given object or array. The only nested objects that get cloned by default are: plain objects, arrays, `Map` instances, and `Set` instances.

The default behavior aims to support the most popular use cases. See “Customized cloning” below if you need more control.

By default, non-enumerable properties and computed properties are copied losslessly. Note that you can opt out of this behavior if you need better performance (see “Faster cloning” below).

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.cloneDeep()
```

### Faster cloning

You can pass the `FastCloningStrategy` for better performance, but bear in mind the following tradeoff.

All plain objects and class instances are cloned with `{...obj}`. This means that the original prototype, computed properties, and non-enumerable properties are not preserved.

Also note that built-in, complex objects like `RegExp` and `Date` are still not cloned with this cloning strategy. You can override the `cloneOther` function if you need to clone these object types.

### Customized cloning

“Cloning strategies” control how certain object types are handled by `cloneDeep`. You can pass in a custom strategy, which may even be a partial strategy. Any undefined methods in your strategy will inherit the default logic. Your custom methods can return `null` to use the default logic, or they can return the received object to skip cloning.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.cloneDeep(obj, {
  // Clone arrays with default logic if they are not frozen.
  cloneArray: array => (Object.isFrozen(array) ? array : null),
})
```

If you clone the object in your custom method, make sure to pass the clone into the `track` function before cloning the nested objects. Here's an example with `cloneOther` that handles a custom class instance.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.cloneDeep(obj, {
  cloneOther: (obj, track, clone) => {
    if (obj instanceof MyClass) {
      // 1. Create a new instance and track it.
      const clone = track(new MyClass())

      // 2. Copy over the properties of the original instance.
      for (const key in obj) {
        clone[key] = clone(obj[key])
      }

      // 3. Return the cloned instance.
      return clone
    }

    // Use default logic for anything else.
    return null
  },
})
```
