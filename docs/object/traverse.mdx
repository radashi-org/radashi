### Usage

Recursively visit each property of an object (or each element of an array) and its nested objects or arrays. To traverse non-array iterables (e.g. `Map`, `Set`) and class instances, see the [Traversing other objects](#traversing-other-objects) section.

Traversal is performed in a depth-first manner. That means the deepest object will be visited before the last property of the root object.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const root = { a: { b: 2 }, c: [1, 2] }

_.traverse(root, (value, key, parent, context) => {
  const depth = context.parents.length
  console.log(' '.repeat(depth * 2), key, '=>', value)
})
// Logs the following:
//   a => { b: 2 }
//     b => 2
//   c => [1, 2]
//     0 => 1
//     1 => 2
```

**Tip:** Check out the [Advanced](#advanced) section to see what else is possible.

:::tip[Did you know?]

- Sparse arrays don't have their holes visited.
- Circular references are skipped.

## Types

### TraverseVisitor

The `TraverseVisitor` type represents the function passed to `traverse` as its 2nd argument. If you ever need to declare a visitor separate from a `traverse` call, you can do so by declaring a function with this type signature.

```ts
import { TraverseVisitor } from 'radashi'

const visitor: TraverseVisitor = (value, key, parent, context) => {
  // ...
}
```

### TraverseContext

Every visit includes a context object typed with `TraverseContext`, which contains the following properties:

- `key`: The current key being visited.
- `parent`: The parent object of the current value.
- `parents`: An array of objects (from parent to child) that the current value is contained by.
- `path`: An array describing the key path to the current value from the root.
- `skip`: A function used for skipping traversal of an object. If no object is provided, the current value is skipped. See [Skipping objects](#skipping-objects) for more details.
- `skipped`: A set of objects that have been skipped.
- `value`: The current value being visited.

:::danger

The `path` and `parents` arrays are mutated by the `traverse` function. If you need to use them after the current visit, you should make a copy.

:::

### TraverseOptions

You may set these options for `traverse` using an object as its 3rd argument.

- `ownKeys`: A function that returns the own enumerable property names of an object.
- `rootNeedsVisit`: A boolean indicating whether the root object should be visited.

See the [Options](#options) section for more details.

## Options

### Traversing all properties

By default, non-enumerable properties and symbol properties are skipped. You can pass in a custom `ownKeys` implementation to control which object properties are visited.

This example shows how `Reflect.ownKeys` can be used to include non-enumerable properties and symbol properties. Note that symbol properties are always traversed last when using `Reflect.ownKeys`.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const symbol = Symbol('b')
const root = { [symbol]: 1 }
Object.defineProperty(root, 'a', { value: 2, enumerable: false })

_.traverse(
  root,
  (value, key) => {
    console.log(key, '=>', value)
  },
  { ownKeys: Reflect.ownKeys },
)
// Logs the following:
//   a => 2
//   Symbol(b) => 1
```

### Visiting the root object

By default, your `visitor` callback will never receive the object passed into `traverse`. To override this behavior, set the `rootNeedsVisit` option to true.

When the root object is visited, the `key` will be `null`.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const root = { a: 1 }

_.traverse(
  root,
  (value, key) => {
    console.log(key, '=>', value)
  },
  { rootNeedsVisit: true },
)
// Logs the following:
//   null => { a: 1 }
//   a => 1
```

## Advanced

### Traversing other objects

If traversing plain objects and arrays isn't enough, try calling `traverse` from within another `traverse` callback like follows. This takes advantage of the fact that the root object is always traversed.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

// Note how we're using a named visitor function so it can reference itself.
_.traverse(root, function visitor(value, key, parent, context, options) {
  if (value instanceof MyClass) {
    return _.traverse(value, visitor, options, context)
  }
  // TODO: Handle other values as needed.
})
```

If you didn't set any options, the `options` argument can be null:

```ts
return _.traverse(root, visitor, null, context)
```

### Skipping objects

Using the `TraverseContext::skip` method, you can prevent an object from being traversed. By calling `skip()` with no arguments, the current value won't be traversed.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const root = {
  a: { b: 1 },
  c: { d: 2 },
}

_.traverse(root, (value, key, parent, context) => {
  console.log(key, '=>', value)

  // Skip traversal of the 'a' object.
  if (key === 'a') {
    context.skip()
  }
})
// Logs the following:
//   a => { b: 1 }
//   c => { d: 2 }
//   d => 2
```

You can pass any object to `skip()` to skip traversal of that object.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const root = {
  a: {
    b: {
      c: 1,
    },
  },
}

_.traverse(root, (value, key, parent, context) => {
  console.log(key, '=>', value)

  // Visit the properties of the current object, but skip any objects nested within.
  Object.values(value).forEach(nestedValue => {
    if (_.isObject(nestedValue)) {
      context.skip(nestedValue)
    }
  })
})
// Logs the following:
//   a => { b: { c: 1 } }
//   b => { c: 1 }
```

### Exiting early

If your `visitor` callback returns false, `traverse` will exit early and also return false. This is useful if you found what you wanted, so you don't need to traverse the rest of the objects.

```ts
let found = null
_.traverse(root, value => {
  if (isWhatImLookingFor(value)) {
    found = value
    return false
  }
})
```

### Leave callbacks

If your `visitor` callback returns a function, it will be called once `traverse` has visited every visitable property/element within the current object. This is known as a “leave callback”.

Your leave callback can return false to exit traversal early.

```ts
_.traverse({ arr: ['a', 'b'] }, (value, key) => {
  if (isArray(value)) {
    console.log('start of array')
    return () => {
      console.log('end of array')
      return false
    }
  } else {
    console.log(key, '=>', value)
  }
})
// Logs the following:
//     start of array
//     0 => 'a'
//     1 => 'b'
//     end of array
```
