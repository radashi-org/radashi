title: isEmptyRecord
description: Checks if a plain object has 0 own keys
---

## Description

Returns true if the given object has no properties of its own. Inherited properties are not considered.

## Example

```ts
import { isEmptyRecord } from 'radashi'

isEmptyRecord({}) // => true
isEmptyRecord({ a: 1 }) // => false
```

## Explanation

In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties from their prototypes. This function specifically checks if a plain JavaScript object has any _own_ properties (also known as _own keys_).

It's a more performant way of doing `Object.keys(obj).length === 0`, because no intermediate array is created.
