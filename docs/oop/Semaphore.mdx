### Usage

A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that allows a limited number of concurrent operations to proceed.

```ts
import { Semaphore } from 'radashi'

const semaphore = new Semaphore(2)

const permit = await semaphore.acquire()

permit.release()
```

When the semaphore's capacity is reached, subsequent calls to `semaphore.acquire()` will block until a permit is released.

```ts
import { Semaphore } from 'radashi'

const semaphore = new Semaphore(1)

const permit = await semaphore.acquire() // Acquires the only permit

// This next acquire call will block until the first permit is released
const blockingAcquire = semaphore.acquire()

// ... later ...
permit.release() // Releasing the permit allows blockingAcquire to resolve
```

You can acquire permits with a specific `weight`. The semaphore's capacity is reduced by this weight. If the remaining capacity is less than the requested weight, the acquisition will block.

```ts
import { Semaphore } from 'radashi'

const semaphore = new Semaphore(4)

// Acquire a permit with weight 2
const permit = await semaphore.acquire({ weight: 2 })

// Capacity is now 2. Acquiring with weight 1 or 2 is possible.
await semaphore.acquire({ weight: 1 })

// Acquiring with weight 2 would block now as capacity is only 1.
```

A permit can only be released once. Subsequent calls to `permit.release()` on the same permit instance will have no effect.

```ts
import { Semaphore } from 'radashi'

const semaphore = new Semaphore(1)
const permit = await semaphore.acquire()

permit.release() // Releases the permit
permit.release() // Has no effect
```

The semaphore constructor requires a `maxCapacity` of more than 0. Acquiring a permit requires a `weight` of more than 0 and not exceeding the semaphore's `maxCapacity`. Invalid options will result in errors.

```ts
import { Semaphore } from 'radashi'

// Invalid constructor
// new Semaphore(0) // Throws Error: maxCapacity must be > 0

const semaphore = new Semaphore(2)

// Invalid acquire options
// await semaphore.acquire({ weight: 0 }) // Throws Error: weight must be > 0
// await semaphore.acquire({ weight: 3 }) // Throws Error: weight must be ≤ maxCapacity
```

You can abort a pending acquisition using an [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) and its signal. If the signal is aborted before the permit is acquired, the acquire promise will reject with an `AbortError`.

```ts
import { Semaphore } from 'radashi'

const semaphore = new Semaphore(1)
await semaphore.acquire() // Occupy the only permit

const controller = new AbortController()
const acquirePromise = semaphore.acquire({ signal: controller.signal })

// Abort the acquisition before it can complete
controller.abort()

// The acquirePromise will now reject
await expect(acquirePromise).rejects.toThrow('This operation was aborted')
```

You can reject all pending and future acquisition requests by calling `semaphore.reject()`. All promises returned by pending and future `acquire` calls will reject with the provided error.

```ts
import { Semaphore } from 'radashi'

const semaphore = new Semaphore(1)
await semaphore.acquire() // Occupy the only permit

const acquirePromise = semaphore.acquire() // This will block

const rejectionError = new Error('Operation cancelled')
semaphore.reject(rejectionError)

// The acquirePromise will now reject with the specified error
await expect(acquirePromise).rejects.toThrow('Operation cancelled')

// Future acquisition requests will also be rejected
await expect(() => semaphore.acquire()).rejects.toThrow('Operation cancelled')
```
