### Usage

The `clamp` function restricts a number to be within a specified
range.

- It takes three arguments: the number to clamp, the minimum value,
  and the maximum value.
- If the number is less than the minimum, it returns the minimum.
- If the number is greater than the maximum, it returns the
  maximum.
- Otherwise, it returns the number itself.

```ts twoslash
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const inRange = _.clamp(5, 1, 10) // 5
const smaller = _.clamp(0, 1, 10) // 1
const bigger = _.clamp(15, 1, 10) // 10
```

#### Invalid ranges

If the minimum is greater than the maximum, an error is thrown.

```ts twoslash
import * as _ from 'radashi'
// ---cut-before---

const clamped = _.clamp(1, 10, 1) // throws Error
```
