description: Calculates the sum of numbers in a spiral pattern
---

### Usage

The `spiralSum` function calculates the sum of numbers in a unique spiral pattern up to a specified number of terms.

```ts
import { spiralSum } from 'radashi'

spiralSum(5) // => 25
```

### How It Works

The spiral pattern is formed by summing consecutive odd numbers:

1. First term: 1
2. Second term: 1 + 3 = 4
3. Third term: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
4. Fourth term: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
5. Fifth term: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25

And so on...

### Edge Cases

- If `n` is 0 or negative, the function returns 0.

```ts
spiralSum(0) // => 0
spiralSum(-1) // => 0
```

## Notes

This function is primarily used for testing and demonstration purposes. It provides a simple way to generate an interesting numerical sequence based on a spiral pattern of odd numbers.
