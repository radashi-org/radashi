### Usage

Adds a leading slash `/` to the given URL if it is not already present.

This function is useful for ensuring that URLs are properly formatted
with a leading slash, which is often required in web development for
consistency and to avoid issues with relative paths.

```ts
import { withLeadingSlash } from 'radashi'

withLeadingSlash('') // => '/'
withLeadingSlash('no/slash') // => '/no/slash'
withLeadingSlash('/already/has/slash') // => '/already/has/slash'
withLeadingSlash(undefined) // => undefined
withLeadingSlash(null) // => null
```
