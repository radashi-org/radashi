### Usage

Adds a trailing slash `/` to the given URL if it is not already present.

This function is useful for ensuring that URLs are properly formatted
with a trailing slash, which is often required in web development for
consistency and to avoid issues with relative paths.

```ts
import { withTrailingSlash } from 'radashi'

withTrailingSlash('') // => '/'
withTrailingSlash('no/slash') // => 'no/slash/'
withTrailingSlash('already/has/slash/') // => 'already/has/slash/'
withTrailingSlash(undefined) // => undefined
withTrailingSlash(null) // => null
```
