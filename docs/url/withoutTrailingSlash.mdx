### Usage

Removes the trailing slash `/` from the given URL if it is present.

This function is useful for ensuring that URLs are properly formatted
without a trailing slash, which is often required in web development for
consistency and to avoid issues with relative paths.

```ts
import { withoutTrailingSlash } from 'radashi'

withoutTrailingSlash('') // => ''
withoutTrailingSlash('no/slash/') // => 'no/slash'
withoutTrailingSlash('already/has/slash') // => 'already/has/slash'
withoutTrailingSlash(undefined) // => undefined
withoutTrailingSlash(null) // => null
```
