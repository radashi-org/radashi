### Usage

This is useful when you need to pass a function somewhere, but you don't care when it runs or what it receives.

Since `noop` has a function signature of `() => undefined`, you will be warned by TypeScript if you pass it where a function is expected to return something different.

```ts twoslash
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.noop() // => undefined
```

### FAQ

- **Shouldn't I just use `?.` operator?**  
  Where possible, yes you should. The `noop` is best for cases where you're not in control of the code that calls it and a function is required.
