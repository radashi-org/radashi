### Usage

The `similarity` function computes the Levenshtein distance between two input strings. This distance represents the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other.

This function is useful for various applications, including:

- Spell checking and autocorrect features
- Fuzzy string matching
- DNA sequence analysis
- Plagiarism detection

The function is case-sensitive and treats whitespace as significant characters. The order of the input strings doesn't affect the result, as the Levenshtein distance is symmetric.

```typescript
import * as _ from 'radashi'

// Identical strings
_.similarity('hello', 'hello') // => 0

// One character difference
_.similarity('kitten', 'mitten') // => 1

// Multiple differences
_.similarity('saturday', 'sunday') // => 3

// Case sensitivity
_.similarity('foo', 'FOO') // => 3

// Whitespace significance
_.similarity('bar ', 'bar') // => 1

// Argument order doesn't matter
_.similarity('abc', 'cba') // => 2
_.similarity('cba', 'abc') // => 2
```

The function returns a `number` representing the Levenshtein distance between the two input strings. A lower number indicates higher similarity, with 0 meaning the strings are identical.
