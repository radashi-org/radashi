### Usage

Trims all prefix and suffix characters from the given string. Like the builtin trim function but accepts alternate (other than space) characters you would like to trim.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.trim('  hello ') // => hello
_.trim('__hello__', '_') // => hello
_.trim('/repos/:owner/', '/') // => repos/:owner
```

Trim also handles more than one character to trim.

```ts
_.trim('222__hello__111', '12_') // => hello
```
