### Usage

Trim specific characters from the start and end of a given string. Like the built-in `String.prototype.trim` method, but it accepts alternate (other than space) characters you would like to trim.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.trim('  hello ', ' ') // => hello
_.trim('__hello__', '_') // => hello
_.trim('/repos/:owner/', '/') // => repos/:owner
```

It also handles more than one character to trim.

```ts
_.trim('222__hello__111', '12_') // => hello
```
