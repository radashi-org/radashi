description: Convert a string to snake case
since: 12.1.0

### Usage

Given a string returns it in snake case format.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.snake('green fish blue fish') // => green_fish_blue_fish
```

**Warning**: In v11.0.0 a change was made to _fix_ this function so that it correctly splits numbers from neighboring letters (`hello5` becomes `hello_5`). You can opt out of this behavior and continue with the legacy style (`hello5` becomes `hello5`) by passing the `splitOnNumber` options.

```ts
_.snake('5green fish 2blue fish') // => 5_green_fish_2_blue_fish

_.snake('5green fish 2blue fish', {
  splitOnNumber: false,
}) // => 5green_fish_2blue_fish
```
