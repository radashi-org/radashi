description: Create a dynamic proxied a object

### Usage

Javascript's `Proxy` object is powerful but a bit awkward to use. The `_.proxied` function creates the `Proxy` for you and handles calling back to your handler when functions on the `Proxy` are called or properties are accessed.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

type Property = 'name' | 'size' | 'getLocation'

const person = _.proxied((prop: Property) => {
  switch (prop) {
    case 'name':
      return 'Joe'
    case 'size':
      return 20
    case 'getLocation'
      return () => 'here'
  }
})

person.name // => Joe
person.size // => 20
person.getLocation() // => here
```

### Search terms

- Often called `proxied`, `dynamicProxy`, or `propertyInterceptor` in other libraries.

### Popular use cases

- Dynamically transforming or computing the values of object properties based on their names when accessed.
- Creating virtual objects that derive values on-the-fly, avoiding the need for pre-defined properties.
- Implementing flexible APIs where property access triggers custom logic or data retrieval, based on the property name.
- Simplifying code by allowing properties to be accessed without explicitly defining them, with logic applied during access.
