description: Create a function that runs at most once
since: 12.2.0

### Usage

Create a wrapper around a given function such that it executes at most once. Subsequent calls to the wrapped function return the result from the first execution, regardless of the arguments provided. This behavior is akin to memoization but specifically designed for single-use functions. The result of the first call is stored internally, allowing for efficient retrieval without recomputation.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fn = _.once(() => Math.random())
fn() // 0.5
fn() // 0.5
```

### Resetting the function

The `once.reset` function clears the stored result of a function that was previously wrapped with `once`. This allows the function to be executed again as if it were never called before, enabling dynamic reuse of the function with fresh computations.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fn = once(() => Math.random())
fn() // 0.5
fn() // 0.5

once.reset(fn)
fn() // 0.3
fn() // 0.3
```

### Search terms

- Often called `once`, `runOnce`, or `singleCall`

### Popular use cases

- Ensuring that a function executes only a single time, regardless of how many times it is invoked.
- Protecting sensitive or resource-heavy operations by restricting their execution to just one successful call.
- Managing initialization logic, such as setting up global state or event listeners, so they only occur once.
- Offering the ability to reset the function, allowing the operation to be executed again if needed, without repeated execution by default.
