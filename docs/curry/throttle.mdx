title: throttle
description: Creates a throttled function that limits invocations to a specified interval
since: 12.1.0
---

### Usage

The `throttle` function creates a new function that, when called, will only execute the original function at most once per specified time interval. This is useful for limiting the rate at which a function can fire, especially for performance-intensive operations like handling scroll or resize events.

The function accepts two parameters:

1. An options object with:
   - `interval`: The minimum time (in milliseconds) between function invocations
   - `trailing` (optional): If true, also calls the function after the throttle period if it was invoked during the throttle
2. The function to be throttled

The returned throttled function also includes these methods:

- `isThrottled(): boolean`: To check if there's currently an active throttle
- `trigger(...args): void`: To invoke the wrapped function without waiting for the next interval

```typescript
import * as _ from 'radashi'

// Throttle a scroll event handler
const handleScroll = () => {
  console.log('Scroll position:', window.scrollY)
}
const throttledScroll = _.throttle({ interval: 200 }, handleScroll)
window.addEventListener('scroll', throttledScroll)

// Throttle an API call
const throttledFetch = _.throttle(
  { interval: 5000, trailing: true },
  async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
    const data = await response.json()
    console.log(data)
  },
)

// Check if throttled
console.log('Is throttled:', throttledFetch.isThrottled())
```

### Timing

A visual representation of the throttle behavior when `interval` is set to `200ms`:

```
Time: 0ms - - - - 100ms - - - - 200ms - - - - 300ms - - - - 400ms - - - -
Throttle Invocations: x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x - - -
Source Invocations: x - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - -
```

When the `trailing` option is set to `true`, an additional invocation occurs after the throttle period if any calls were made during the throttled time:

```
Time: 0ms - - - - 100ms - - - - 200ms - - - - 300ms - - - - 400ms - - - -
Throttle Invocations: x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Source Invocations: x - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - -
```

In this diagram, 'x' represents function invocations, and '-' represents time passing.
