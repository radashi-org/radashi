const add = (a: number, b: number) => a + b

const addFive = _.partial(add, 5)

addFive(2) // => 7
```

- Often called `partial`, `partialApply`, or `preFillArgs`

### Popular use cases

- Pre-filling some arguments of a function, creating a new function with fewer parameters for easier reuse.
- Simplifying complex operations by partially applying constant values, reducing the need for repetitive code.
- Adapting functions with multiple parameters for use in situations where fewer arguments are passed over time.
- Streamlining callback creation in scenarios where only a subset of the original function's arguments is known upfront.
