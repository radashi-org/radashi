title: flip
group: 'Curry'
description: Swap the only two arguments of a function
---

### Usage

Return a new function that swaps the only two arguments of the original function. This is most useful for reversing the order of a “comparator” (i.e. a function used for sorting).

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const subtract = (a: number, b: number) => a - b

subtract(1, 2) // => -1
_.flip(subtract)(1, 2) // => 1
```

Note that functions with more than two arguments are not supported.

### Search terms

- Often called `flipArgs`, `reverseArgs`, or `swapParams`

### Popular use cases

- Reversing the order of the first two arguments in a function, making it easier to work with curried or partial applications.
- Adapting functions to match the argument order expected by other higher-order functions or utilities.
- Swapping arguments for improved readability in specific contexts, especially in functional programming.
- Simplifying complex function compositions by adjusting the argument order dynamically.
