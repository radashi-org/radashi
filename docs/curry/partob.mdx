### Usage

Modern javascript destructuring means a lot of developers, libraries, and frameworks are all opting for unary functions that take a single object that contains the arguments. The `_.partob` function let's you partob these unary functions.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const add = (props: { a: number; b: number }) => props.a + props.b

const addFive = _.partob(add, { a: 5 })

addFive({ b: 2 }) // => 7
```

### Search terms

- Often called `partialObject`, `partob`, or `partialProps`

### Popular use cases

- Partially applying default properties or options to a function that accepts a single object argument, reducing code repetition.
- Creating specialized versions of object-based functions by pre-filling certain properties while allowing others to be supplied later.
- Simplifying configuration-heavy functions by breaking them down into smaller steps, where each step completes the object with additional fields.
- Reducing verbosity when working with functions that rely heavily on object destructuring by providing default values upfront.
