title: debounce
description: Delay a function until after a specified time has elapsed since the last call

### Usage

The `debounce` function helps manage frequent function calls efficiently. It requires two inputs: a `delay` time (in milliseconds) and a callback. When you use the function returned by `debounce` (a.k.a. the “debounced function”), it doesn't immediately run your callback. Instead, it waits for the specified `delay`.

If called again during this waiting period, it resets the timer. Your source function only runs after the full `delay` passes without interruption. This is useful for handling rapid events like keystrokes, ensuring your code responds only after a pause in activity.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

// Send a search request to the API server when the user stops typing
// for at least 100ms.
input.addEventListener(
  'change',
  _.debounce({ delay: 100 }, (event: InputEvent) => {
    api.movies.search(event.target.value)
  }),
)
```

## Options

### leading

When the `leading` option is `true`, your callback is invoked immediately the very first time the debounced function is called. After that, the debounced function works as if `leading` was `false`.

```ts
const myDebouncedFunc = _.debounce({ delay: 100, leading: true }, x => {
  console.log(x)
})

myDebouncedFunc(0) // Logs "0" immediately
myDebouncedFunc(1) // Never logs
myDebouncedFunc(2) // Logs "2" about 100ms later
```

## Methods

### cancel

The `cancel` method of the debounced function does two things:

1. It cancels any pending invocations of the debounced function.
2. It permanently disables the debouncing behavior. All future invocations of the debounced function will immediately invoke your callback.

```ts
const myDebouncedFunc = _.debounce({ delay: 100 }, x => {
  console.log(x)
})

myDebouncedFunc(0) // Never logs
myDebouncedFunc(1) // Never logs
myDebouncedFunc.cancel()
myDebouncedFunc(2) // Logs "2" immediately
```

### flush

The `flush` method will immediately invoke your callback, regardless of whether the debounced function is currently pending.

```ts
const myDebouncedFunc = _.debounce({ delay: 100 }, x => {
  console.log(x)
})

myDebouncedFunc(0) // Logs "0" about 100ms later
myDebouncedFunc.flush(1) // Logs "1" immediately
```

### isPending

The `isPending` method returns `true` if there is any pending invocation of the debounced function.

```ts
const myDebouncedFunc = _.debounce({ delay: 100 }, x => {
  console.log(x)
})

myDebouncedFunc(0) // Logs "0" about 100ms later
myDebouncedFunc.isPending() // => true
setTimeout(() => {
  myDebouncedFunc.isPending() // => false
}, 100)
```

### Search terms

- Often called `debounce`, `debouncedFunc`, or `throttleDebounce`

### Popular use cases

- Delaying execution of expensive operations, such as API requests or calculations, until a user has stopped interacting with the interface.
- Controlling the frequency of function execution, particularly for user inputs like typing, scrolling, or resizing events.
- Reducing the number of times a heavy computation or UI update is triggered in response to frequent actions.
- Ensuring that a function is called after a pause in actions, with methods to cancel, check status, or force execution.
