title: debounce
description: Delay a function until after a specified time has elapsed since the last call
since: 12.1.0
---

### Usage

Create a new function that delays invoking a callback until after a specified time has elapsed since the last call.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

// Debounce a search function to avoid making API calls on every keystroke
const searchAPI = _.debounce({ delay: 300 }, async query => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/search?q=${query}`)
    const results = await response.json()
    displayResults(results)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Search failed:', error)
  }
})

// Simulate user typing in a search box
document.querySelector('#search-input').addEventListener('input', event => {
  const query = event.target.value
  searchAPI(query)
})

function displayResults(results) {
  // Update UI with search results
  console.log('Search results:', results)
}
const debouncedProcessData = _.debounce({ delay: 100 }, processData)
```

## Options

### leading

When the `leading` option is `true`, your callback is invoked immediately the very first time the debounced function is called. After that, the debounced function works as if `leading` was `false`.

```ts
const debouncedFunc = _.debounce({ delay: 100, leading: true }, x => {
  console.log(x)
})

debouncedFunc(0) // Logs "0" immediately
debouncedFunc(1) // Never logs
debouncedFunc(2) // Logs "2" about 100ms later
```

## Return type

The `DebounceFunction` type is used to represent a debounced function in TypeScript. It has the following properties:

- `callee`: The underlying function that is debounced.
- `flush`: A method that forces a debounced call to execute immediately.
- `cancel`: A method that cancels a debounced function.

### Flushing

The `flush` method forces a debounced call to execute immediately. If no call was currently scheduled, this method does nothing. So you're effectively saying “execute the function now, but only if it's scheduled to execute.”

```ts
const debouncedFunc = _.debounce({ delay: 1000 }, () => {
  console.log('Flushed')
})

debouncedFunc.flush()
```

The `flush` method is set to [`noop`](/reference/function/noop) when no pending call is scheduled.

### Cancelling

The `cancel` method can be used to cancel a debounced function. Future calls still get debounced, but the currently pending call is immediately cancelled.

```ts
const debouncedFunc = _.debounce({ delay: 1000 }, () => {
  console.log('Flushed')
})

debouncedFunc()
debouncedFunc.cancel()
```
