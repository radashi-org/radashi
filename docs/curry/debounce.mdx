description: Create a debounced callback function
---

### Usage

Debounce accepts an options object with a `delay` and a source function to call
when invoked. When the returned function is invoked it will only call the source
function after the `delay` milliseconds of time has passed. Calls that don't result
in invoking the source reset the delay, pushing off the next invocation.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const makeSearchRequest = event => {
  api.movies.search(event.target.value)
}

input.addEventListener('change', _.debounce({ delay: 100 }, makeSearchRequest))
```

### Timing

A visual of the debounce behavior when `delay` is `100`. The debounce function
returned by `debounce` can be called every millisecond but it will only call
the given callback after `delay` milliseconds have passed.

```sh
Time: 0ms - - - - 100ms - - - - 200ms - - - - 300ms - - - - 400ms - - - -
debounce Invocations: x x x x - - - - - - - - x x x x x x x x x x - - - - - - - - - - - -
Source Invocations: - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - -
```

### Cancel

The function returned by `debounce` has a `cancel` method that when called will permanently stop the source function from being debounced.

```ts
const debounced = _.debounce({ delay: 100 }, api.feed.refresh)

// ... sometime later

debounced.cancel()
```

### Flush

The function returned by `debounce` has a `flush` method that when called will directly invoke the source function.

```ts
const debounced = _.debounce({ delay: 100 }, api.feed.refresh)

// ... sometime later

debounced.flush(event)
```

### isPending

The function returned by `debounce` has a `isPending` method that when called will return if there is any pending invocation the source function.

```ts
const debounced = _.debounce({ delay: 100 }, api.feed.refresh)

// ... sometime later

debounced.isPending()
```
