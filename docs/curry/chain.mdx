title: chain
description: Create a chain of function to run in order
since: 12.1.0
---

### Usage

Chaining functions will cause them to execute one after another, passing the output from each function as the input to the next, returning the final output at the end of the chain.

```ts twoslash
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const add = (y: number) => (x: number) => x + y
const multiply = (y: number) => (x: number) => x * y
const addFive = add(5)
const double = multiply(2)

const chained = _.chain(addFive, double)

chained(0) // => 10
chained(7) // => 24
```

### Example

```ts twoslash
import * as _ from 'radashi'

type Deity = {
  name: string
  rank: number
}

const gods: Deity[] = [
  { rank: 8, name: 'Ra' },
  { rank: 7, name: 'Zeus' },
  { rank: 9, name: 'Loki' },
]

const getName = (god: Deity) => god.name
const upperCase = (text: string) => text.toUpperCase() as Uppercase<string>

const getUpperName = _.chain(getName, upperCase)

getUpperName(gods[0]) // => 'RA'
gods.map(getUpperName) // => ['RA', 'ZEUS', 'LOKI']
```
