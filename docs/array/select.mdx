### Usage

Applies a filter and a map operation at once and in one pass.
If the filter is omitted, returns all non-nullish mapped values.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    weight: 105,
    source: 'ocean',
  },
  {
    name: 'Bass',
    weight: 8,
    source: 'lake',
  },
  {
    name: 'Trout',
    weight: 13,
    source: 'lake',
  },
]

_.select(
  fish,
  f => f.weight,
  f => f.source === 'lake',
) // => [8, 13]
```
