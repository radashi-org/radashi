title: unzip
description: Group array elements by their index position across the input arrays
---

### Usage

Creates an array of ungrouped elements, where each resulting array contains all elements at a specific index from the input arrays. The first array contains all first elements, the second array contains all second elements, and so on.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.unzip([
  ['a', 1, true],
  ['b', 2, false],
])
// => [
//   ['a', 'b'],
//   [1, 2],
//   [true, false],
// ]
```

### Search terms

- Often called `ungroup`, `split`, or `transpose` in other libraries.

### Popular use cases

- Transforming an array of grouped elements into a separate array for each index, such as converting an array of coordinate pairs into separate arrays for x and y values.
- Handling parallel arrays in scenarios where values need to be processed independently, like separating user data fields into distinct arrays for names, ages, and statuses.
- Manipulating data in multi-dimensional arrays, especially when preparing datasets for analytical functions that require segregated values for processing, like separating features for machine learning applications.
