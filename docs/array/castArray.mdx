### Usage

The `castArray` function ensures that the input value is always returned as an array. If the input is already an array, it returns a shallow copy of the array. If the input is not an array, it wraps the input in a new array.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.castArray(1) // => [1]
_.castArray([1, 2, 3]) // => [1, 2, 3]
_.castArray('hello') // => ['hello']
```

### Search terms

- Commonly referred to as `arrayify`, `toArray`, or `ensureArray` in other libraries.

### Popular use cases

- Converting single values or objects into an array format for consistent data handling.
- Preparing values for APIs or functions that expect array inputs regardless of whether the original input was a single value or an array.
- Ensuring safe manipulation of data collections by avoiding direct mutations or invalid operations on heterogeneous types.
- Simplifying data transformations in functional programming contexts, especially when working with optional values like `null` or `undefined`.
- Facilitating collection management by treating various input types uniformly, such as combining user inputs with pre-existing arrays seamlessly.
