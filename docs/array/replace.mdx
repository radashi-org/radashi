### Usage

Given an array of items, replace the one that matches the given condition function. Only replaces the first match. Always returns a copy of the original array.

```ts twoslash
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    weight: 105,
  },
  {
    name: 'Bass',
    weight: 8,
  },
  {
    name: 'Trout',
    weight: 13,
  },
]

const salmon = {
  name: 'Salmon',
  weight: 22,
}

// read: replace fish with salmon where the name is Bass
const replaced = _.replace(fish, salmon, f => f.name === 'Bass') // => [marlin, salmon, trout]
```
