### Usage

Given an array of items -- and optionally, a function to determine their identity -- return a new array without any duplicates.

The function does not preserve the original order of items.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    weight: 105,
    source: 'ocean',
  },
  {
    name: 'Salmon',
    weight: 22,
    source: 'river',
  },
  {
    name: 'Salmon',
    weight: 22,
    source: 'river',
  },
]

_.unique(fish, f => f.name)
// [
//     { name: 'Marlin', weight: 105, source: 'ocean' },
//     { name: 'Salmon', weight: 22, source: 'river' }
// ]
```
