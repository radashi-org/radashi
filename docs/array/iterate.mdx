### Usage

A bit like `forEach` meets `reduce`. Useful for running a function `n` number of times to generate a value. The `_.iterate` function takes a count (the number of times to run the callback), a callback function, and an initial value. The callback is run _count_ many times as a reducer and the accumulated value is then returned.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const value = _.iterate(
  4,
  (acc, idx) => {
    return acc + idx
  },
  0,
) // => 10
```

Note, this is **NOT** zero indexed. If you pass a `count` of 5 you will get an index of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the callback function.

### Search terms

- Often called `repeat`, `count`, or `accumulate` in other libraries.

### Popular use cases

- Computing the sum of the first `n` natural numbers through iterative addition.
- Applying a transformation function over a defined number of iterations to generate a sequence.
- Calculating factorials or Fibonacci numbers by leveraging custom iterative logic.
- Performing custom reductions without the overhead of constructing an array.
- Creating complex mathematical series or computations that rely on iteration rather than array-based methods.
