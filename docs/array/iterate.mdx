### Usage

A bit like `forEach` meets `reduce`. Useful for running a function `n` number of times to generate a value. The `_.iterate` function takes a count (the number of times to run the callback), a callback function, and an initial value. The callback is run _count_ many times as a reducer and the accumulated value is then returned.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const value = _.iterate(
  4,
  (acc, idx) => {
    return acc + idx
  },
  0,
) // => 10
```

Note, this is **NOT** zero indexed. If you pass a `count` of 5 you will get an index of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the callback function.
