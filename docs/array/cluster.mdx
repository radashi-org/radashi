### Usage

Given an array of items and a desired cluster size (`n`), returns an array
of arrays. Each child array containing `n` (cluster size) items
split as evenly as possible.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const gods = [
  'Ra',
  'Zeus',
  'Loki',
  'Vishnu',
  'Icarus',
  'Osiris',
  'Thor',
  'Apollo',
  'Artemis',
  'Athena',
]

_.cluster(gods, 3)
// => [
//   [ 'Ra', 'Zeus', 'Loki' ],
//   [ 'Vishnu', 'Icarus', 'Osiris' ],
//   ['Thor', 'Apollo', 'Artemis'],
//   ['Athena']
// ]
```
