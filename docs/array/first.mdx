- Often called `head`, `firstElement`, or `initial` in other libraries.

### Popular use cases

- Retrieve the first element from an array in scenarios such as accessing the first item in a list, obtaining the primary value in a data structure, or initializing variables with default values.
- Provide a fallback default value when the input array is empty, useful in cases where a default or sentinel value is required for logical operations.
- Simplify array manipulation tasks in functional programming patterns, especially when working with collections or streams of data.
- Facilitate safe access to array elements, preventing undefined behavior in applications that depend on array content for functionality.
