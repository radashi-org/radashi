### Usage

Given an array of items and a condition, returns two arrays where the first contains all items that passed the condition and the second contains all items that failed the condition.

```ts twoslash
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const gods = [
  {
    name: 'Ra',
    power: 100,
  },
  {
    name: 'Zeus',
    power: 98,
  },
  {
    name: 'Loki',
    power: 72,
  },
  {
    name: 'Vishnu',
    power: 100,
  },
]

const [finalGods, lesserGods] = _.fork(gods, f => f.power > 90) // [[ra, vishnu, zeus], [loki]]
```
