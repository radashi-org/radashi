description: Sorts an array of objects alphabetically by a property
since: 12.1.0

### Usage

Given an array of objects and a callback function used to determine
the property to use for sorting, return a new array with the objects
sorted alphabetically. A third, and optional, argument allows you to
sort in descending order instead of the default ascending order.

For numerical sorting, see the [sort](./sort) function.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const gods = [
  {
    name: 'Ra',
    power: 100,
  },
  {
    name: 'Zeus',
    power: 98,
  },
  {
    name: 'Loki',
    power: 72,
  },
  {
    name: 'Vishnu',
    power: 100,
  },
]

_.alphabetical(gods, g => g.name) // => [Loki, Ra, Vishnu, Zeus]
_.alphabetical(gods, g => g.name, 'desc') // => [Zeus, Vishnu, Ra, Loki]
```
