title: castArrayIfExists
description: Cast a non-nullish value into an array
---

### Usage

The `castArrayIfExists` function ensures that a non-nullish input value is always returned as an array. If the input is already an array, it returns a shallow copy of the array. If the input is not an array, it wraps the input in a new array. Nullish values (null or undefined) are passed through as is.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.castArrayIfExists(1) // => [1]
_.castArrayIfExists([1, 2, 3]) // => [1, 2, 3]
_.castArrayIfExists('hello') // => ['hello']
_.castArrayIfExists(null) // => null
_.castArrayIfExists(undefined) // => undefined
```

### Search terms

- Often referred to as `arrayifyIfExists`, `toArrayIfPresent`, or `ensureArrayIfNotNull` in other libraries.

### Popular use cases

- Safely converting inputs to an array while handling cases where the input could be `null` or `undefined`.
- Guarding against errors in data processing by ensuring that only valid values are transformed into array form.
- Enhancing functions that require array inputs by providing flexibility for optional values, streamlining the handling of user inputs.
- Preparing data for APIs or libraries that may not handle `null` or `undefined` gracefully by filtering out such values.
- Simplifying the management of optional parameters in functions, making it easier to work with variables that may or may not have meaningful data.
