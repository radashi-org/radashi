description: Flatten an array of arrays into a single dimension
since: 12.1.0

### Usage

Given an array that contains many arrays, return a new array where all items from the children are present at the top level.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const gods = [['ra', 'loki'], ['zeus']]

_.flat(gods) // => [ra, loki, zeus]
```

Note, `_.flat` is not recursive and will not flatten children of children of children ... of children. It will only flatten `T[][]` an array of arrays.
