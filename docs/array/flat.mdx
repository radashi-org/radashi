description: Flatten an array of arrays into a single dimension
since: 12.1.0

### Usage

Given an array that contains many arrays, return a new array where all items from the children are present at the top level.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const gods = [['ra', 'loki'], ['zeus']]

_.flat(gods) // => [ra, loki, zeus]
```

Note, `_.flat` is not recursive and will not flatten children of children of children ... of children. It will only flatten `T[][]` an array of arrays.

### Search terms

- Often called `flatten`, `flattenArray`, or `arrayFlatten` in other libraries.

### Popular use cases

- Flattening multi-dimensional arrays into single arrays for easier iteration and data processing.
- Merging nested arrays containing diverse data types (e.g., numbers, strings) into a single, normalizable data structure.
- Preparing array data for functions that require a linear input, such as mapping or filtering operations.
- Simplifying the structure of complex nested arrays when transforming or converting data formats.
