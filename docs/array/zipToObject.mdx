const names = ['ra', 'zeus', 'loki']
const cultures = ['egypt', 'greek', 'norse']

_.zipToObject(names, cultures)
// => { ra: egypt, zeus: greek, loki: norse }

_.zipToObject(names, (k, i) => k + i)
// => { ra: ra0, zeus: zeus1, loki: loki2 }

_.zipToObject(names, null)
// => { ra: null, zeus: null, loki: null }
```
