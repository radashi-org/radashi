### Usage

Given an array of items, create a dictionary with keys and values mapped by given functions.
First argument is the array to map. The second argument is the function to determine the key
for each item. The third argument is optional and determines the value for each item.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    weight: 105,
  },
  {
    name: 'Bass',
    weight: 8,
  },
  {
    name: 'Trout',
    weight: 13,
  },
]

_.objectify(fish, f => f.name) // => { Marlin: [marlin object], Bass: [bass object], ... }
_.objectify(
  fish,
  f => f.name,
  f => f.weight,
) // => { Marlin: 105, Bass: 8, Trout: 13 }
```
