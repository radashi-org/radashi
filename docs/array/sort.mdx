### Usage

Given an array of objects, return a new array sorted by the numerical property specified in the get function. A third, and optional, argument allows you to sort in descending order instead of the default ascending order.

This function only supports numerical sorting. For alphabetic sorting, see the [alphabetical](./alphabetical) function.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    weight: 105,
  },
  {
    name: 'Bass',
    weight: 8,
  },
  {
    name: 'Trout',
    weight: 13,
  },
]

_.sort(fish, f => f.weight) // => [bass, trout, marlin]
_.sort(fish, f => f.weight, true) // => [marlin, trout, bass]
```
