title: boil
description: 'Reduce a list of items down to one item'

### Usage

Given an array of items return the final item that wins the comparison condition. Useful for more complicated min/max.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const gods = [
  {
    name: 'Ra',
    power: 100,
  },
  {
    name: 'Zeus',
    power: 98,
  },
  {
    name: 'Loki',
    power: 72,
  },
]

_.boil(gods, (a, b) => (a.power > b.power ? a : b))
// => { name: 'Ra', power: 100 }
```

### Why not just use `Array.prototype.reduce`?

The benefit of using `boil` is that your reducer's return value is type-checked to ensure it matches the type of the items in the array. This fits a more specific use case than `Array.prototype.reduce`, where you know you want to reduce an array down to just one of its items. Overall, `boil` is more strict about the values your reducer will receive and return.
