### Usage

Given an array of items, `group` will build up an object where each key is an array of the items that belong in that group. Generally, this can be useful to categorize an array.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    source: 'ocean',
  },
  {
    name: 'Bass',
    source: 'lake',
  },
  {
    name: 'Trout',
    source: 'lake',
  },
]

const fishBySource = _.group(fish, f => f.source) // => { ocean: [marlin], lake: [bass, trout] }
```

### Popular use cases

- Grouping data items based on specific criteria such as even/odd numbers or string lengths using custom group ID functions.
- Organizing complex data structures (e.g., objects, arrays of objects) by keys based on property values to enhance data retrieval and manipulation.
- Reducing a large dataset into categorized sections for more efficient data analysis, reporting, or visualization (e.g., grouping users by age, purchases by category).
- Implementing custom filters to separate and analyze subsets of an array for business logic, such as dividing users based on status (e.g., active, inactive) or product types (e.g., electronics, apparel).
