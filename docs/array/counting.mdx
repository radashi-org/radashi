### Usage

Given an array of objects and an identity callback function to determine
how each object should be identified. Returns an object where the keys
are the id values the callback returned and each value is an integer
telling how many times that id occurred.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const gods = [
  {
    name: 'Ra',
    culture: 'egypt',
  },
  {
    name: 'Zeus',
    culture: 'greek',
  },
  {
    name: 'Loki',
    culture: 'greek',
  },
]

_.counting(gods, g => g.culture) // => { egypt: 1, greek: 2 }
```
