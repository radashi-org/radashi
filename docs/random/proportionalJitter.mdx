### Usage

Add proportional noise to a base value by scaling a random offset with a given factor.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const base = 100
_.proportionalJitter(base, 0.1) // => a number between 90 and 110
```

Basically, the example above is saying "add 10% noise to the base value", in either direction (plus or minus).
