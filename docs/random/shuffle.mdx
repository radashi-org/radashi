### Usage

Create a new array with the items of the given array but in a random order. The randomization is done using the [Fisher-Yates algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle), which is mathematically proven to be unbiased (i.e. all permutations are equally likely).

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    weight: 105,
    source: 'ocean',
  },
  {
    name: 'Salmon',
    weight: 22,
    source: 'river',
  },
  {
    name: 'Salmon',
    weight: 22,
    source: 'river',
  },
]

_.shuffle(fish)
```

You can provide a custom random function to make the shuffle more or less random. The custom random function takes minimum and maximum values and returns a random number between them.

```ts
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const customRandom = (min, max) =>
  Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
_.shuffle(array, customRandom)
```
