### Usage

Create a new array with the items of the given array but in a random order. The randomization is done using the [Fisher-Yates algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle), which is mathematically proven to be unbiased (i.e. all permutations are equally likely).

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const fish = [
  {
    name: 'Marlin',
    weight: 105,
    source: 'ocean',
  },
  {
    name: 'Salmon',
    weight: 22,
    source: 'river',
  },
  {
    name: 'Salmon',
    weight: 22,
    source: 'river',
  },
]

_.shuffle(fish)
```
