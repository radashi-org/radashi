## Basic usage

Generates a random integer between `min` and `max`. The range is inclusive on both ends, so `randomInt(0, 1)` will return 0 or 1.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.randomInt(0, 100) // => 27
```

**Note:** This uses `Math.random` for randomness, so it's not cryptographically secure. It's also biased (some results are more likely than others). Most of the time, this won't be a problem.
