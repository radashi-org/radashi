### Usage

Generates a unique string with optional special characters.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.uid(7) // => UaOKdlW
_.uid(20, '*') // => dyJdbC*NsEgcnGjTHS
```

Note, this function is optimized for simplicity and usability -- not performance or security. If you need to create universally unique or cryptographically random strings use a package specifically for that purpose.
