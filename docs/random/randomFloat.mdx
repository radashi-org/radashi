title: randomFloat
description: Generate a random number in a range
---

## Basic usage

Generate a random number between a given minimum and maximum value. The minimum is inclusive and the maximum is exclusive. In other words, `randomFloat(0, 1)` will never return 1.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.randomFloat(10, 20) // 15.442857721â€¦
```

**Note:** This uses `Math.random` for randomness, so it's not cryptographically secure. It's also biased (some results are more likely than others). Most of the time, this won't be a problem.
