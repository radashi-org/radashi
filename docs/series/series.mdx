title: series
description: Create an ordered series object
---

### Usage

The series function allows you to work with ordered values from an enum or union type, such as a status, by returning an object for performing ordered logic.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

type Weekday = 'monday' | 'tuesday' | 'wednesday' | 'thursday' | 'friday'

const weekdays = _.series<Weekday>([
  'monday',
  'tuesday',
  'wednesday',
  'thursday',
  'friday',
])

weekdays.min('tuesday', 'thursday') // => 'tuesday'
weekdays.max('wednesday', 'monday') // => 'wednesday'
weekdays.next('wednesday') // => 'thursday'
weekdays.previous('tuesday') // => 'monday'
weekdays.first() // => 'monday'
weekdays.last() // => 'friday'
weekdays.next('friday') // => null
weekdays.next('friday', weekdays.first()) // => 'monday'
weekdays.spin('monday', 3) // => 'thursday'
```

### Complex Data Types

For objects, pass a second argument to `series`: a function that converts non-primitive values into an identity that can be checked for equality.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

type Weekday = {
  day: 'monday' | 'tuesday' | 'wednesday' | 'thursday' | 'friday'
}

const weekdays = _.series<Weekday>(
  [
    { day: 'monday' },
    { day: 'tuesday' },
    { day: 'wednesday' },
    { day: 'thursday' },
    { day: 'friday' },
  ],
  w => w.day,
)

weekdays.next({ day: 'wednesday' }) // => { day: 'thursday' }
weekdays.previous({ day: 'tuesday' }) // => { day: 'monday' }
```
