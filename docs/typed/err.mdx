### Usage

Create an `Err` instance of `Result` containing the provided error.
Note, this is included to be more ergonomic and explicit than constructing the object manually, but comes with a small amount of overhead due to the function call.
If you want to avoid that overhead, you can create the object manually: `{ ok: false, value: undefined, error }`.

**Don't know what that is?** Read the [Result](/typed/isResult#result) section in the [isResult](/typed/isResult) documentation.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const errResult = _.err(404) // type is Err<number>
const result: Result<string, Error> = _.err(new Error('Something went wrong'))
```

Also see the related [ok](/typed/ok) function.
