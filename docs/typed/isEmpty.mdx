description: 'Determine if a value is empty'

### Usage

Pass in a value and get a boolean telling you if the value is empty.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.isEmpty([]) // => true
_.isEmpty('') // => true

_.isEmpty('hello') // => false
_.isEmpty(['hello']) // => false
```

### Radashi vs [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) Implementations

The handling of constructor function prototypes differs between the Radashi
and Lodash libraries. This is due to the fact that the use of constructor
functions, an older practice, has largely been replaced by classes since the
introduction of [ECMAScript 2015](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/).
As a result, we decided not to support this approach.

```typescript
import * as radashi from 'radashi'
import * as lodash from 'lodash'

function Foo() {}
Foo.prototype = { constructor: Foo }

console.log(radashi.isEmpty(Foo.prototype)) // false
console.log(lodash.isEmpty(Foo.prototype)) // true
```

In this example, the `constructor` property on the prototype is handled
differently. Lodash considers the prototype to be empty due to its specific
approach to the `constructor` property. On the other hand, Radashi does not
consider the prototype to be empty.

```typescript
import * as radashi from 'radashi'
import * as lodash from 'lodash'

function Foo() {}
Foo.prototype = { name: 'John Doe' }

console.log(radashi.isEmpty(Foo.prototype)) // false
console.log(lodash.isEmpty(Foo.prototype)) // false
```

In this example, we can see that the difference is exclusively related to
the `constructor` property.
