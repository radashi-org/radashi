### Usage

Returns true for `WeakMap` instances, even if they are subclass instances or from
other [realms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof#instanceof_and_multiple_realms).

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.isWeakMap(new WeakMap()) // true
_.isWeakMap(new (class extends WeakMap {})()) // true
```
