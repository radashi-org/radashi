### Usage

Create an `Ok` instance of `Result` containing the provided value.
Note, this is included to be more ergonomic and explicit than constructing the object manually, but comes with a small amount of overhead due to the function call.
If you want to avoid that overhead, you can create the object manually: `{ ok: true, value, error: undefined }`.

**Don't know what that is?** Read the [Result](/typed/isResult#result) section in the [isResult](/typed/isResult) documentation.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const okResult = _.ok(42)
const result: Result<string, Error> = _.ok('Hello, world!')
```

Also see the related [err](/typed/err) function.
