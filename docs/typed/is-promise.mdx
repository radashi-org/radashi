## Basic usage

Pass in a value and get a boolean telling you if the value is a Promise. This function is not _"bullet proof"_ because determining if a value is a Promise in javascript is not _"bullet proof"_. The standard/recommended method is to use `Promise.resolve` to essentially cast any value, promise or not, into an awaited value. However, this may do in a pinch.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

_.isPromise('hello') // => false
_.isPromise(['hello']) // => false
_.isPromise(new Promise(res => res())) // => true
```
