### Usage

The `defer` function allows you to run an async function while registering cleanup functions that will execute after it completes. This is useful when you need to clean up resources regardless of whether the main function succeeds or fails, similar to a `finally` block.

The function passed to `defer` receives a `register` function as its argument. Use this to register cleanup work that should run after the main function finishes.

By default, if a cleanup function throws an error after the main function has thrown an error, the cleanup error will be ignored. You can customize this behavior by passing `{ rethrow: true }` to the `register` function to have it rethrow cleanup errors instead.

#### Clean up temporary files

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

// Placeholder functions
const createBuildDir = async () => {
  console.log('Creating build directory...')
  await _.sleep(100)
  console.log('Build directory created.')
  return 'build'
}
const build = async () => {
  console.log('Building project...')
  await _.sleep(100)
  console.log('Project built.')
}

await _.defer(async cleanup => {
  const buildDir = await createBuildDir()

  cleanup(() => fs.unlink(buildDir))

  await build()
})
```

#### Clean up resources in an API

```ts
// Placeholder API
const api = {
  org: {
    create: async () => ({ id: 1 }),
    delete: async () => {
      console.log('Deleting organization...')
      await _.sleep(100)
      console.log('Deleted organization.')
    },
  },
  user: {
    create: async () => ({ id: 2 }),
    delete: async () => {
      console.log('Deleting user...')
      await _.sleep(100)
      console.log('Deleted user.')
    },
  },
}

// Placeholder test function
const executeTest = async () => {
  console.log('Executing test...')
  await _.sleep(100)
  console.log('Test complete.')
}

await _.defer(async register => {
  const org = await api.org.create()
  register(async () => api.org.delete(org.id), { rethrow: true })

  const user = await api.user.create()
  register(async () => api.user.delete(user.id), { rethrow: true })

  await executeTest(org, user)
})
```

### Search terms

- Commonly referenced as `defer`, `cleanup`, or `ensure`

### Popular use cases

- Using `defer` for resource management, such as automatically closing file handles or database connections in a controlled manner after operations complete, ensuring that all cleanup code runs regardless of success or failure.
- Implementing deferred execution for asynchronous tasks, allowing multiple callbacks to be registered that handle cleanup logic, which is especially useful in error-prone operations like network requests or file manipulations.
- Facilitating error handling in complex code flows by automatically executing error handling callbacks, improving code maintainability and readability while simplifying structured cleanup of resources.
