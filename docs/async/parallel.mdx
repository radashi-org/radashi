### Usage

The `parallel` function processes an array with an async callback. The first argument controls how many array items are processed at one time. Similar to `Promise.all`, an ordered array of results is returned.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const userIds = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

// Will run the find user async function 3 at a time
// starting another request when one of the 3 is freed
const users = await _.parallel(3, userIds, async userId => {
  return await api.users.find(userId)
})
```

### Interrupting

Processing can be manually interrupted. Pass an `AbortController.signal` via the `signal` option. When the signal is aborted, no more calls to your callback will be made. Any in-progress calls will continue to completion, unless you manually connect the signal inside your callback. In other words, `parallel` is only responsible for aborting the array loop, not the async operations themselves.

When `parallel` is interrupted by the signal, it throws a `DOMException` (even in Node.js) with the message `This operation was aborted` and name `AbortError`.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const abortController = new AbortController()
const signal = abortController.signal

// Pass in the signal:
const pizzas = await _.parallel(
  { limit: 2, signal },
  ['pepperoni', 'cheese', 'mushroom'],
  async topping => {
    return await bakePizzaInWoodFiredOven(topping) // each pizza takes 10 minutes!
  },
)

// Later on, if you need to abort:
abortController.abort()
```

### Aggregate Errors

Once the whole array has been processed, `parallel` will check for errors. If any errors occurred during processing, they are combined into a single `AggregateError`. The `AggregateError` has an `errors` array property which contains all the individual errors that were thrown.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const userIds = [1, 2, 3]

const [err, users] = await _.tryit(_.parallel)(3, userIds, async userId => {
  throw new Error(`No, I don\'t want to find user ${userId}`)
})

console.log(err) // => AggregateError
console.log(err.errors) // => [Error, Error, Error]
console.log(err.errors[1].message) // => "No, I don't want to find user 2"
```
