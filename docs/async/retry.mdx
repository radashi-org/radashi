### Usage

The `retry` function runs an async function and retries it if it fails. You can specify how many times to retry, how long to wait between retries, and whether to use exponential backoff.

**Options**

- `times` is the maximum number of times to retry (default: `3`)
- `delay` is milliseconds to sleep between retries
- `backoff` is a function called to calculate the delay between retries
  - It receives the attempt number (starting with `1`) and returns the delay in milliseconds.
- `signal` allows you to pass an `AbortController.signal` to interrupt the retry operation

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const api = {
  users: {
    async list() {
      if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
        throw new Error('Random error')
      }
      return []
    },
  },
}

await _.retry({}, api.users.list) // try 3 times before failing
await _.retry({ times: 10 }, api.users.list) // try 10 times before failing
await _.retry({ times: 2, delay: 1000 }, api.users.list) // try 2 times with 1 second delay

// exponential backoff
await _.retry({ backoff: i => 10 ** i }, api.users.list) // try 3 times with 10, 100, 1000 ms delay
```

### Interrupting

If a `signal` is passed, the retry operation can be interrupted. When the signal is aborted, `retry`'s promise will reject with a `DOMException` (even in Node.js) with the message `This operation was aborted` and name `AbortError`.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const abortController = new AbortController()
const signal = abortController.signal

const promise = _.retry({ times: 3, delay: 1000, signal }, api.users.list)

// To stop retrying immediately:
abortController.abort()

try {
  await promise
} catch (err) {
  if (err.message === 'This operation was aborted') {
    console.log('Retry operation was aborted')
  }
}
```
