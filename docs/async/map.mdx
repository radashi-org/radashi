description: Map an array with an async function

### Usage

The `map` function is like `Array.prototype.map`, but it works with async functions. Only one item is processed at a time.

```ts
const userIds = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const api = {
  users: {
    find: async (id: number) => id < 3,
  },
}

const users = await _.map(userIds, async userId => {
  return await api.users.find(userId)
}) // [true, true, false, false]
```

### Search terms

- Often called `asyncMap`, `mapAsync`, or `promiseMap` in other libraries.

### Popular use cases

- Parallel data fetching: Use `map` to iterate over an array of URLs, fetching data from each asynchronously and collecting the results.
- Concurrent processing: Utilize `map` to apply a heavy computation asynchronously on an array of items, such as hashing passwords or processing images.
- Batch processing: Employ `map` to handle bulk updates or inserts in a database where each operation needs to be done asynchronously.
