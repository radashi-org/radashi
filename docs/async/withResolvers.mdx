The ponyfill for https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/withResolvers

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

const { resolve, reject, promise } = _.withResolvers()

resolve(42)
```

### Search terms

- Often called `deferred`, `promiseWithDeferred`, or `promiseResolver` in other libraries.

### Popular use cases

- Handling asynchronous operations in a more controlled manner where you need manual resolution or rejection of a promise, often used for testing or mock implementation.
- Integrating with APIs or libraries that do not natively support promises by enabling conversion from callback-style to promise-style code.
- Coordinating multiple asynchronous operations where one promise's resolution should trigger others, enabling complex workflows or event handling.
