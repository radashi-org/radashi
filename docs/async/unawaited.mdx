title: unawaited
description: Attaches console.error to a given promise
---

### Usage

Pass a promise to `unawaited` to ensure that any rejection is logged to the console instead of resulting in an unhandled promise rejection.

```ts
import * as _ from 'radashi'

async function someAsyncFunction() {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong')
}

_.unawaited(someAsyncFunction())
```
